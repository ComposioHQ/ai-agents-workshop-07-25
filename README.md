# Production AI Agents Workshop ü§ñ

Welcome to the **Production AI Agents Workshop**! This repository contains a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial for building AI agents that are ready for production use.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

This workshop takes you from a simple toy example to a production-ready AI agent system. You'll learn the essential patterns, tools, and practices needed to build, deploy, and maintain AI agents in real-world scenarios.

### üöÄ What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have built:
- A simple coding agent (toy example)
- A multi-agent system with specialized roles
- An agent with state management and memory
- A fully instrumented system with tracing and observability
- A production-ready agent with evaluation and monitoring

### üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **OpenAI API Key** (get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Basic Python knowledge** (functions, classes, async/await)
- **Git** for version control
- **Terminal/Command Line** familiarity

## üó∫Ô∏è Workshop Structure

### üé¨ Introduction & Motivation (30 min)

**What we'll cover:**
- Setting up the development environment

- Analyzing existing production systems (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Key challenges in agent development

**Learning outcomes:**
- Understand the difference between toy examples and production systems
- Identify the key components of a production AI agent
- Set up your development environment

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents-workshop.git
cd ai-agents-workshop
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (we'll do this per module)
```

### 3. Get API Keys

You'll need an OpenAI API key for all modules:

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Keep it secure - you'll add it to each module's `.env` file

### 4. Start with Module 1

```bash
cd 1-toy-example
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Follow the README instructions to set up your .env file
python coding_agent.py
```

## üìö Learning Path

### For Beginners
Start with Module 1 and work through each module sequentially. Each module builds on the previous one.

### For Intermediate Developers
You can jump to specific modules based on your interests:
- **Multi-agent patterns** ‚Üí Module 2
- **State management** ‚Üí Module 3
- **Monitoring** ‚Üí Module 4
- **Testing** ‚Üí Module 5

### For Advanced Users
Focus on Modules 3-5 for production-ready patterns, or use the repository as a reference implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment
